### Hi there, I'm Carson ðŸ‘‹

### About Me
I'm a dedicated and driven student currently pursuing a bachelors degree in software engineering and a minor in game design at the University of Arizona. My interest in engineering began with a fascination for math and problem solving. I was introduced to software engineering in my freshman year and quickly realized it was a perfect fit. During my first year at the university, I've had the opportunity to work on several coding projects that have allowed me to apply my growing knowledge and skill-set. These experiences have not only broadened my coding ability but have also taught me the importance of collaboration and adaptability.

### Education
- Pursuing a degree in software engineering at the University of Arizona
- Minoring in Game Design and Development

### Current Goals
At the moment I'm looking to further my studies and continue growing as a software engineer at my university. I'm also looking to intern, so I can gain some professional insight into the industry and continue to expand my knowledge. I hope to intern and work at a game studio in my future, so I can continue learning about my passion for games and programming alike.
